# README:

I am currently pursuing Master's in Computer Science at Northeastern University, Boston. <br />
Having no industrial experience, I have worked on some academic projects, namely:<br />
* **_INFORMATION RETRIEVAL SYSTEM:_** Using two Retrieval Models (BM-25 Retrieval Model and tf-idf Retrieval Model),
created a search engine which uses crawled data and generate index to search a given query.<br />
* **_BLUETOOTH CHAT APP:_** Developed an Android app which uses Bluetooth functionality (instead of mobile data) to text<br /><br />

This repository is for assignments and project for Web Development(CS-5610).<br /><br />
