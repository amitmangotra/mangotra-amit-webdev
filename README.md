# README:

I am currently pursuing Master's in Computer Science at Northeastern University, Boston.
Having no industrial experience, I have worked on some academic projects, namely:
-> INFORMATION RETRIEVAL SYSTEM: Using two Retrieval Models (BM-25 Retrieval Model and tf-idf Retrieval Model),
created a search engine which uses crawled data and generate index to search a given query.
-> BLUETOOTH CHAT APP: Developed an Android app which uses Bluetooth functionality (instead of mobile data) to text
